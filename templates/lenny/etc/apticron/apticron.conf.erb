#
# Set DIFF_ONLY to "1" to only output the difference of the current run
# compared to the last run (ie. only new upgrades since the last run). If there
# are no differences, no output/email will be generated. By default, apticron
# will output everything that needs to be upgraded.

# Set LISTCHANGES_PROFILE if you would like apticron to invoke apt-listchanges

# Set SYSTEM if you would like apticron to use something other than the output
# of "hostname -f" for the system name in the mails it generates
#

# Set IPADDRESSNUM if you would like to configure the maximal number of IP
# addresses apticron displays. The default is to display 1 address of each
# family type (inet, inet6), if available.

#
# Set IPADDRESSES to a whitespace seperated list of reachable addresses for
